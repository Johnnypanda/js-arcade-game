## Project requirements

Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.

## How to play

To play the game click on this [link](http://johnnypanda.github.io/js-arcade-game) .

## How it was built

I was provided whith starting js files (engine and resources).
My task was to add functionality to the app.js files to make the whole thing work.
The maim thing was to use the skills of object oriented programming I've gained from
Object Oriented Programming section of the course.
